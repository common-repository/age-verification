Requires users to provide their date of birth before they can access your site

== Description ==

This plugin forces users to provide their date of birth before they can access your site.  Their age must meet some configurable age.  Their age will be remembered in a cookie that will last for a configurable duration.  Plain text fields or dropdown fields can be configured.  The interface is bare -- it is expected that you will do some work to integrate this into your site's design.  You can also exclude registered users from the name check (for instance, so authors aren't subjected to it).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the file to your `plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin
